            "Few New Zealanders would fail to recognise harakeke, one of our most distinctive native plants. It is the principal weaving plant, and many weavers use named forms selected for leaf pliability, colour and fibre quality.",
            "Leaf strips are used in raranga, the plaiting of kete (containers) and whāriki (mats). Extracted fibre (muka or whītau) is used to make traditional kākahu (cloaks), and for cordage. Today, harakeke is also used in non-traditional ways to create original and exciting works of art.",
            "Harakeke grows throughout New Zealand, from sea level to about 1300 m in altitude. It is commonly found in lowland wetlands and along rivers, and in coastal areas on estuaries, dunes and cliffs. A hundred years ago, harakeke was much more abundant in many regions, but large wild stands today are diminished and scattered. Harakeke is often seen in gardens, is used widely in landscaping projects and in wetland restoration plantings, and as shelter belts on farmland.",
            "Harakeke is a herbaceous plant, meaning its growth form is soft, not woody. The robust, sword-like leaves are arranged in two adjoining sets around the growing point (rito) to form a fan. A unique feature of harakeke and related plants is that the lower third or so of each leaf is folded together along its midrib or keel. This creates a stiff, heavy butt."

            "Lancewood, or horoeka, is a unique, small tree with lance-like foliage that changes dramatically as the tree matures. In fact, young trees are so different from adults that early botanists believed they were different species. Juveniles have a very straight and thin trunk without branches and a cluster of long, narrow, deflexed leaves at the top. Adult leaves are less than half the length of the juvenile’s leaves and twice the width, and they form a rounded crown at the top of the tree.",
            "Lancewood is a common plant found throughout lowland and montane forests and shrublands on the North, South and Stewart Islands. The juvenile form is particularly abundant in regenerating bush and along forest edges, especially in lowland areas.",
            "There are three species of lancewood, all called horoeka by Māori. The rarest is fierce lancewood, so named because of its shark-tooth projections along the leaf margins. Plants are either male or female. The small, greenish-yellow flowers are pollinated by insects. The purplish-black fruits are an important food source for whitehead, tūī and wood pigeon/ kererū when they occur in autumn and winter. In Māori lore, the flowering of lancewood was an indication that birds would be plentiful the following year, because the fruits take a whole year to ripen. Lancewood can grow up to 15 metres high, with a trunk 50 centimetres in diameter. It has smooth bark, with rope-like ridges in the juvenile form. Plants remain in their juvenile stage for about 15–20 years.",
            "Scientists call the condition of having very distinct juvenile and adult forms ‘heteroblasty’. There is no general agreement about why certain plant species do this, but scientists have several competing theories. One theory suggests that it evolved as a response to moa browsing, and that once trees grew above moa height, they no longer needed the special defences of their juvenile leaves. Another theory proposes that the change occurs as a response to the climatic changes that the trees undergo as they move from the understory up to the sub-canopy. A third theory suggests that the change occurs because of a reallocation of resources as plants grow. Young plants presumably need to allocate more resources to gaining height to prevent being shaded by other plants, while adults can devote more energy to making leaves and branches."

The Nikau grows up to 15 m tall, with a stout green trunk which bears grey-green leaf scars. The trunk is topped by a smooth bulging crown shaft up to 1m long. The fronds are up to 3m long, and the closely-set, sometimes overlapping leaflets are up to 1 m long. The inflorescence is multi-branched and from 200 to 400 mm long. The tightly packed flowers are unisexual and coloured lilac to pink. Male flowers are borne in pairs and have 6 stamens. The female flowers are solitary. The fruit is elliptic or oblong, and generally measures about 10 by 7 mm, and is red when ripe.",
            "The nikau makes an excellent potted plant, and is quite hardy. It tends to be slow-growing. It grows readily from seed if the fruit is soaked in water for a few days and then gently scrubbed to remove the flesh. The seed will then germinate readily if placed in sealed plastic bags in partial shade, after which they can be planted in deep pots. The pots should be tall and narrow to provide room for the taproot and to lessen the likelihood of root damage when transplanting.",
            "Māori found many uses for the nikau palm. The bases of the inner leaves and the young flower clusters were eaten raw or cooked. Food was wrapped in the leaves for cooking, and the old fibrous leaves were used for baskets, floor mats, and waterproof thatch for buildings."

            "The pohutukawa tree (Metrosideros excelsa) with its crimson flower has become an established part of the New Zealand Christmas tradition. This iconic Kiwi Christmas tree, which often features on greeting cards and in poems and songs, has become an important symbol for New Zealanders at home and abroad.",
            "In 1833 the missionary Henry Williams described holding service under a ‘wide spreading pohutukawa’. The first known published reference to the pohutukawa as a Christmas tree came in 1857 when ‘flowers of the scarlet Pohutukawa, or “Christmas tree”’ formed part of table decorations at a feast put on by Ngāpuhi leader Eruera Patuone. Several years later Austrian geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter noted that settlers referred to it as such. The pohutukawa, he observed, ‘about Christmas … are full of charming … blossoms’; ‘the settler decorates his church and dwellings with its lovely branches’. Other 19th-century references described the pohutukawa tree as the ‘Settlers Christmas tree’ and ‘Antipodean holly’.",
            "Pohutukawa and its cousin rata also hold a prominent place in Maori tradition. Legends tell of Tawhaki, a young Maori warrior, who attempted to find heaven to seek help in avenging the death of his father. He fell to earth and the crimson flowers are said to represent his blood.",
            "A gnarled, twisted pohutukawa on the windswept cliff top at Cape Reinga, the northern tip of New Zealand, has become of great significance to many New Zealanders. For Maori this small, venerated pohutukawa is known as ‘the place of leaping’. It is from here that the spirits of the dead begin their journey to their traditional homeland of Hawaiki. From this point the spirits leap off the headland and climb down the roots of the 800-year-old tree, descending into the underworld on their return journey."

            "In the Wanganui region, where totara was not common, the Maori used the wood of matai for carving. Its other uses were for canoes, canoe bailers, small agricultural implements and handles. The Maori also drank the liquid (matai beer) obtained from the cracks in heart matai to treat consumption and as an antiseptic. The advent of the European found matai attaining an exaggerated reputation for durability and its unwise use for house blocks and fence posts; matai is not durable, being similar in that regard to kauri. It is however a superb above ground timber with excellent machining qualities, stability and hardness. It is especially suited to heavy duty floors and wooden door and window joinery. Bushmen used to drill into hollow matai to tap the “matai beer” and they too used it to check consumption and as an antiseptic.",
            "Matai is found throughout New Zealand and very rarely on Stewart Island. It is most common in the Central Plateau in the North Island with other important areas being the West Coast, SE Nelson, the Seaward Kaikouras and western Southland in the South Island. In the North Island it grows from sea level to 760 metres and in the South Island to 300 metres. It appears to favour warmer areas with moist but well drained alluvial soils of the type usually found on river terraces. There is some indication that it grows better at a higher pH then most other podocarps and reputedly forms mor soils.",
            "Matai grows to 25 metres (rarely 30m) in height with diameters up to1.3 metres. The largest recorded tree, at Lake Ianthe south of Hokitika, is 23 metres tall and 2.35 metres in diameter and is reputed to be over 1000 years old. Growth rates of naturally grown trees are very slow with the fastest recorded growth rate being about 1mm annually. Planted matai is likewise slow with height growth of saplings and poles averaging 20 cm annually. Diameter growth ranges from 2 to 5 mm annually.",
            "The hard timber of this tree was used extensively in New Zealand for flooring during the mid-20th century. Matai is not threatened, although as a forest-type it has been greatly reduced through widespread logging. Very few intact examples of Matai-dominated forest remain."

            "Kahikatea grows throughout New Zealand and is commonest in riverine and swamp forests where it is often found in almost pure stands. It was in such a location, on the Waihou River near Thames, in 1794 that the British ship Fancy secured 200 spars ranging in length from 18 to 43 metres. Although kauri was growing on nearby hills it is recorded that most of this cargo was kahikatea which soon rotted. The susceptibility of sap kahikatea to borer and rot has severely limited the use of the timber of this species because heartwood, which is reasonably durable, is slow to form and is more prominent in kahikatea from hilly sites.",
            "The Tuhoe people reputedly used kahikatea for carving because it carves easily across the grain and holds a sharp edge. But because of its perishable nature no early carvings have survived. In places where totara and kauri were not available it was also used for canoes and soot from burnt wood was used as a tattooing pigment. A decoction of leaves was used for urinary and other internal complaints and a recipe involving bark for bruises. The other main use by the Maori was of the swollen seed receptacle (usually referred to as a berry) which is used as a food. Often present in large quantities, it was easily collected and there are records of feasts where 60 baskets of kahikatea berries were provided. The prolific production of fruit also attracted pigeons and tui so these forests were good places to hunt. Apart from misuse of the timber for naval purposes, the early Europeans sawed logs into wide clear lengths of timber which were exported to Australia, but use was limited until it was discovered that it did not taint food. Thin boards were then used to make boxes in which butter was packed for export and this continued until the advent of the strong cardboard box. With the advent of treatment against borer most sawn timber went into wide facia and weather boards. Because it is light and easily worked it was also used for boat building and is still in demand today. A recently discovered use, linked to its freedom from odour and taste, is as cake baking container.",
            "The Genus Dacrycarpus consists of species of tall trees found from Burma and China in the north, through New Guinea to New Zealand. The sole New Zealand species is kahikatea which is found throughout the country and may have been our commonest conifer. In the North Island it grows from sea level to 750 metres, this upper level decreasing further south so that it is scarcely above sea-level on Stewart Island. It is most abundant in high rainfall areas and occupies a wide range of soils. The fastest growth rates are on deep, well drained river terraces.",
            "The largest tree recorded in Burstall and Sale is near Ngongotaha and in 1980 was 50 metres tall and 1.84 cm diameter. Annual growth rates of planted trees range from 10 to over 70 cm height and 8 to 108 mm diameter"
